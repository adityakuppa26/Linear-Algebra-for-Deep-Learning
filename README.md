# Scalar 
  
A scalar or scalar quantity in physics is a physical quantity that can be described by a single element of a number field such as a real number, often accompanied by units of measurement.  
We usually give scalars lowercase variable names. For example, we might say “Let s ∈ R be the slope of the line,” while deﬁning a real valued scalar, or “Let n ∈ N be the number of units,” while deﬁning a natural number scalar.  
  
# Vector  
  
A vector is an array of numbers. The numbers are arranged in order. We can identify each individual number by its index in that ordering. Typically we give vectors lowercase names in bold typeface, such as **x**.  
We can think of vectors as identifying points in space, with each element giving the coordinate along a diﬀerent axis.

# Matrix
  
A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers, so each element is identiﬁed by two indices instead of just one. We usually give matrices uppercase
variable names with bold typeface, such as **A** .  
If a real-valued matrix **A** has a height of m and a width of n, then we say that **A** has an order of m x n.

# Tensor  
  
In some cases we will need an array with more than two axes. In the general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes is known as a tensor. We denote a tensor named “A” with this typeface : **A**. We identify the element of **A** at coordinates (i,j,k) by writing A<sub>i,j,k</sub> .
